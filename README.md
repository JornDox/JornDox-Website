_DISCLAIMER: YOU SHOULD USE VITE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION. to deploy using github pages, visit [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy#github-pages)_
However, if you do not use vite, you cannot access the mapbox from now (not a big deal). 
Website will still work, but not with the fancy map. A default placeholder image would be shown.
